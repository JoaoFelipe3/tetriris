Tetris, made with the [Iris](https://github.com/Marcos-cat/iris) library for Uiua.

To run this, install the latest development version of Uiua, `git clone` this repo, and run it with `uiua run`.

Gameplay-wise, this supports SRS, although there is still a bug with the hard drop. If you can fix this and any other bugs that may exist, please PR!
